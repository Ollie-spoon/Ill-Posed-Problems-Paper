# Ill-Posed-Problems-Paper
A codebase to go alongside the paper "Ill-posed problems: How to think about and approach them."

The two **files contain** the nessecary **code to produce the results** presented in **Appendix A** (bi-exponential-derivative-analysis.py) and **Appendix B** (multi-exponential-decay-resolvability-analysis.py).

The numerical integral function in the second of these files can be used the other way round to verify whether or not an exponential decay fit is actually resolvable or not. It can also be used in conjuncion with bootstrapping to produce a statistical measure of whether or not a distribution of fits is resolvable, althought this is more computationally intensive.
